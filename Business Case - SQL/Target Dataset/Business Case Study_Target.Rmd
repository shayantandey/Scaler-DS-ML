This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Creating the dataset in the databse by:
1. Creating the database named Target
2. Uploading the CSV files to the Target database as tables

```{r}
target_db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "Target")

sellers <- read.csv("sellers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
products <- read.csv("products.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
payments <- read.csv("payments.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
orders <- read.csv("orders.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
order_reviews <- read.csv("order_reviews.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
order_items <- read.csv("order_items.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
geolocation <- read.csv("geolocation.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
customers <- read.csv("customers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

dbWriteTable(target_db, "sellers", sellers, append = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(target_db, "products", products, append = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(target_db, "payments", payments, append = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(target_db, "orders", orders, append = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(target_db, "order_reviews", order_reviews, append = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(target_db, "order_items", order_items, append = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(target_db, "geolocation", geolocation, append = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(target_db, "customers", customers, append = TRUE)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(target_db, "SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10;")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
